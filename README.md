# mygame
This is the repository for my game. It's one of my first games, written entirely in tkinter with the python programming language. 
If you have suggestions for me, do a commit (or something) and I will accept it if it's good. 


The idea for my game is simple: there will be two teams: red and blue. Each team will have certain positions: 
  1. Leader
  2. Medic
  3. Artillery
  4. Protector
  
The leader is the biggest of them all (obviously). They have the most power, with two options to choose when they get promoted: Heavy Spray, or Power Sniper. I think it's obvious what they do. They also have good movement speed, and a lot of health, with decent health regeneration. If the leader dies, the team loses, and the other team wins. 

The medic is the health restorer of the team. When they use their power button, players within a 350 pixel radius will get increased health regeneration, and their health will increase along with that. They have decent movement speed, and around 1/2 the health of the leader. The medic has max health regeneration. 

The artillery of the team provides power to bullets. When the use their power button, players within a 350 pixel radius will get their bullet stats boosted for 30 seconds. They will have increased bullet speed, bullet damage, and better bullet camoflauge. They themselves have the most bullet speed and the most bullet damage on the team. They get a decent sniper to accomplish this. 

The protector, true to their name, protects the team. When they use their power button, players directly within a 500 pixel radius will be shielded with an unbreakable shield for 20 seconds. They themselves will get a boost in body damage. The protector is the most protected on the entire team, with max body damage. Don't go into them! 

This is the idea for my game, I don't know if it'll be fun or not.
